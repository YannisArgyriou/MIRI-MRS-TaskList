# MIRI_FringeAdventures
Series of python notebooks summarizing the different aspects of MIRI detector interference, in a somewhat ordered fashion. Feedback is welcome and very much needed.  
  
List of notebooks:  
0 - Fringes everywhere  
1 - Wavelength calibration  
2 - Determining the fringe transmission (etalon data)  
3 - Etalon data - extended versus point source  
4 - Point source fringes  
5 - Fringe transmission as function of location on PSF  
6 - Fringes - point source versus extended source  
7 - Deriving detector optical properties from MIRI fringes  
8 - Scanning the MIRI SW detector  
9 - [Under Construction] Modeling the MIRI detectors
